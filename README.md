### Overview
Our project is building a game level design DSL that allows users with a basic knowledge of programming to build a simple Mario-like platformer game.

### Code Authorship Acknowledgement
The tokenizer that we implemented was heavily based off the tokenizer that we have seen in class.
A few points to consider, however, are:
1. The tokenizer was written from scratch, since we had to translate into Python from Java.
2. There were changes to the tokenize method to handle whitespaces in our language.
3. Our project was quite substantial in that most of the time was spent on parsing, building the game, and implementing the loop functionality, all of which were original work.
