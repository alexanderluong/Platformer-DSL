User #1: CPSC student, 4th year, took CPSC 311, very comfortable with EBNF's

Was shown a snippet of sample code and the EBNF

Summary of what happened:

I told Kevin to try and make a game using our language. He was able to figure out with some guidance on how to make a pyramid with the goal on top. He also was able to make the colours of the pyramid blocks flash and alternate quite easily and quickly. 

Feedback presented:
- Confused on how to make a starting point for the player
- Coordinate grid system should be easier defined (i.e. is 0, 0 top left corner or bottom left corner)

Otherwise, intuitive loop system and statements. Said that it would be intuitive to use after trying it for a longer time.
