User #1: CPSC student, 4th year, took CPSC 311, very comfortable with EBNF's

Was shown a snippet of sample code and the EBNF

Feedback presented:
- Confused on how to make a starting point for the player
- Coordinate grid system should be easier defined (i.e. is 0, 0 top left corner or bottom left corner)

Otherwise, intuitive loop system and statements. Said that it would be intuitive to use after trying it for a longer time.
