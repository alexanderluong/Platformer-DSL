User #2: UBC Electrical Engineering Graduate

Was shown a revised snippet of example code (from User #1)

Differences of the snippet from first user study:
- Initialized a block called "ground" that covers the entire bottom of the arena 
     - Initialized at 0, 0
- Initialized the position of the player


I explained to Darren that this program is to make a simple Mario-like platformer game. I told Darren to just read the example snippet, go through it, explain what it does, and then make his own game. He was able to easily make a difficult platformer with moving platforms that move towards and way from each other without much guidance at all.

The additions to the sample snippet of code gave him the ability to intuitively figure these things on their own:
- 0, 0 is the bottom left corner of the coordinate system
- The player's start position can be placed in a custom location

Overall feedback was that it was quite intuitive and easy to use.
